(This is basically the forum post)<br>
I've been wanting to host a website for quite some time now. My Raspberry Pi was setup as a media server for the TV in my room, but since my computer is already plugged into it, it was basically being useless.
So, I thought, "Why not use the Pi to host a website?" I looked for a tutorial on it and stumbled across <a href="http://www.tinkernut.com/2012/06/16/how-to-make-a-raspberry-pi-web-server/">this one</a>
and gave it a try. I setup an FTP and Apache(the other one would not install) and then (watched through the entire video again in order to have) found the place the site's page was actually located.<br>
It was pretty straight forward from there, make a new page and let "everyone" read it and it'll be accessable on the web site. Whenever I neeeded to make something on the
site, I'd just look up "x on html" and found the answer.<br>
Pretty cool, I now have my own website with none of the restrictions free hosting services give you!<br>
Don't click refresh spam.
