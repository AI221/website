[os]'s file metadata is extremely similar and based off of <a href="http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/18646-">Lyqyd's standard</a>.<br>
Here's an example of a file's metatable.<br><br><br>
name = "Awesome Image"<br>
author = "oeed"<br>
type = "sketch"<br>
timestamp = {<br>
  accessed = "2, 12:45",<br>
  modified = "1, 9:32",<br>
  created = "1, 9:28",<br>
}<br>
permissions = {<br>
	admin = 2 --Read & write<br>
	app = 1 --Read-only<br>
	guest = 0 --Can't read nor write<br>
	<!--illuminati = 3 --Write-only -->

}<br><br><br>Basically, it's Lyqyd's standard plus file permissions. These should work with native lyqyd meta readers--they will simply ignore the permissions.
